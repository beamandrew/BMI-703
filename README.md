# Precision Medicine I - BMI 703
Notebooks for BMI 703 Guest Lecture on Deep Learning given at Harvard DBMI on 10/12/2017

### Assignment 1 - The Perceptron and Backprop
This assignment covers the basics of backprop, gradient descent, and the perceptron. The notebook is contained in this [pdf](https://github.com/beamandrew/BMI-703/blob/master/backprop_notebook.pdf)


### Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Keras
This assignment details how to implement modern neural nets using the keras framework. The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/beamandrew/BMI-703/blob/master/MLP_keras_notebook.Rmd)

### Convoluational Neural Nets (CNNs)
The final assignment shows how to build a 'real' computer vision system using CNNs. The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/beamandrew/BMI-703/blob/master/CNN_notebook.Rmd)
